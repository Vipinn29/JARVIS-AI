OpenAI Response for Query: using AI write a JavaScript program 
-------------------------

Certainly! Here is a simple JavaScript program that asks for a user's name and then greets them:

```javascript
// Ask user for their name
const name = prompt("What is your name?");

// Greet the user
console.log(`Hello, ${name}! Nice to meet you.`);
```

You can run this program in your browser console or a JavaScript runtime environment like Node.js.
